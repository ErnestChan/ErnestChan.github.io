My name is Ernest Chan. I'm a Master's student in Electrical Engineering (EE) at Rice University specializing in Data Science. I also did my undergraduate degree at Rice in EE and was heading down the traditional EE route until I discovered machine learning. I plan to join industry as a Data Scientist after graduation. Some of my data science/machine learning related projects will be posted on this site.
