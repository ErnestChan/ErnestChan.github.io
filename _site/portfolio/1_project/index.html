    <p>Project Duration: Sept 2014 - May 2015</p>

<p>My senior design project was to develop a system for a heart pump that gives patients an interface to their pump and provides remote monitoring capabilities. The pump, named Aortix<sup>TM</sup>, is the product of a venture-backed biotech company in Houston, <a href="http://www.procyrion.com/" target="_blank">Procyrion Inc</a>, and is undergoing FDA approval.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Here is a single slide description of our project. Our team name was Flowtastic, and the system we developed consisted of 3 parts. Starting at the patient, our Arduino-based system interfaces with the Aortix<sup>TM</sup> pump’s control box. The Arduino system talks to a smart phone app we developed, which talks to an electronic medical record (EMR) system on the doctor’s side. We used an open-source EMR to simulate what the doctor would see.</p>

<p>I worked mainly on the Arduino-based system. The final system recieves data and sends commands to the Aortix<sup>TM</sup> control box via UART. It also communicates via Bluetooth to the smartphone. Because the smartphone is not always connected to the Arduino, there is an SD card on the Arduino for data to be sent. We wrote code for block-sized data storage and retrieval from the SD card. The system is also capable of changing the pump speed based on the patient’s weight fluctuation, or a Doctor’s command, which could be sent from the EMR portal.</p>

<p>Some challenges of this project:</p>

<p>It was interesting working with real-time code, as you’re always in an infinite loop and have to deal with issues different from application code.</p>

<p>Memory limitations. Our program initially used up all of the Arduino Uno’s 2 kB of SRAM, which caused some very abnormal behavior that was hard to debug. After actually writing some code to print out the SRAM usage did we understand the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Figuring out the messaging protocol between the Arduino and the Android phone.</p>
